She found it difficult to buy and sell everyday essentials and electronics when she has to move. This inspired her to create an online marketplace where university community members could buy and sell used items to facilitate the moving process. UniFlea serves as a marketplace, where students, employees, professors, and lecturers can sell, rent, exchange, and share their items",
